Welcome to my Budget Tracker Application! This Budget Tracker will allow you to track both expenses and your income to find your monthly budget. 

Here's how it works: 

To clone this code to your device: git clone https://github.com/your-username/budget-tracker.git
To navigate to actual application: cd budget-tracker

Then follow steps as follows:

1. You will select whether you're entering an expense or an income type
2. You must include a description for your entry type
3. You will enter an amount to be calculated into your budget
4. You must enter a date

This application will not allow you to submit an entry unless all inputs are filled out, this is to accurately give you an idea of what is being calculated. In the event that you need to restart calculations, you will 
have to refresh the page.
